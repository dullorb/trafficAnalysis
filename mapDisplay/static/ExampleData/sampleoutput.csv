"~""ON 6/12/19 I, DEPUTY IZZARD, WAS DISPATCHED TO A TRAIN VS DUMPTRUCK CRASH AT THE RAIL CROSSING ON BAYFIELD RD JUST WEST OF CTY TK E IN THE TWP OF AMNICON, DOUGLAS CO WI. I WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO INJURIES. UPON ARRIVAL, I OBSERVED UNION PACIFIC TRAIN ENGINE UP8190 STOPPED WITH RAIL CARS BLOCKING THE CROSSING. ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE TRAIN, THERE WAS A DUMP TRUCK. THIS AREA IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY THE CN RAIL COMPANY WHO IS ADDING MORE TRACK. I SPOKE WITH THE ENGINEER WHO TOLD ME THE TRAIN WAS MOVING AT APPROX 33 MPH. I SPOKE WITH THE DUMP TRUCK DRIVER WHO TOLD ME THAT THE FLAGMAN DIRECTING TRAFFIC WAIVED HER ACROSS THE CROSSING. THE DRIVER SAID SHE COULDN'T MAKE THE TURN TO THE SOUTH AND BEGAN TO BACK UP TO CORRECT THE TURN WHEN THE TRAIN STRUCK THE TRUCK. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FLAGMAN WAS SUPPOSED TO STOP ALL TRUCK TRAFFIC IN THE WORK AREA WHEN A TRAIN WAS MOVING THROUGH ON THE TRACK. WITNESS DENNIS SOLMONSON (218-821-2733) SAID THAT THE FLAGMAN WAIVED THE STRUCK TRUCK THROUGH THE CROSSING WHEN THE TRAIN WAS MOVING TOWARDS THE ROAD. SOLMONSON CLAIMED THE FLAGMAN SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THE TRUCK BECAUSE THE TRAIN WAS ONLY """"A QUARTER MILE"""" DOWN THE TRACK. TRUCK TOWED BY LAKE CITY DUE TO DAMAGE TO A RIM AND TIRE.""~~
